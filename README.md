# Thesis
Code for my master's Thesis: "Rational approxiamtions of Catalan's constant".
This code consists of Type-I and Type-II Hermite-Pad√© approximations for degrees 1 through 15.
They are using the polynomials already evaluated in -1.
It also includes some plots.
The code is free to use for everyone.
